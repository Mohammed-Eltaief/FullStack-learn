Hello I'm Mohamed Eltaief

my history with programmin started  in high  school when i finished my first course of algorithm and basics of programation with pascal, I was very good on it .
 in that time My dream to be a developper was borned

After obtaining my baccalaureate degrese ,to reach my dream I decided to join the Higher Institute of Technological Studies univercity and learn computer science .
during my education I was the best one in my clasroom at algorithme and programing courses. 

 In 2010 I graduated as a higher  technician in compute science but it was not enoth to get my dreaming job, and i find my self stock in differents jobs  for more than 10 years. In spite of all this, and during this period, I was looking to increase my skills in programming  I was doing a lot of researchs and was geting many cours and Training .

Now I have a main goal is to reverse my carrier to a Fullstack developper in 2023
