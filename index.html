      </p>
      <br>
      <p> After obtaining my baccalaureate degrese ,<b>to reach my dream</b> I decided to join the Higher Institute of Technological Studies univercity and learn computer science .
        during my education <b>I was the best one in my clasroom at algorithme and programing courses.</b>
